# Command: providers pull

The `tofu providers pull` command downloads a specified provider binary into a local directory without
the need to set up an OpenTofu project. This is useful when testing if a provider is correctly present in
an OpenTofu Registry, or when performing security scanning on provider binaries.

## Usage

Usage: `tofu providers pull [options]`

This command accepts the following options:

* `-addr 'ADDR` - Sets the provider address in the `hostname/namespace/type` format, where `hostname` defaults to
  `registry.opentofu.org` and `namespace` defaults to `hashicorp`.

* `-target-dir=/path/to/directory` - Sets the target directory to unpack the provider into. This directory must be
  empty or only used as a provider cache directory. OpenTofu may fail if there are unrelated files in this directory.
  (This is typically the case when using `/tmp`.)
